React is a JS library to build 
fast and interactive user interface
## In the heart of all react applications
-- there is "Components"- a piece of user interface
-- in making a react applications
  -- we create a bunch of independent, isolated,reusable Components
  -- then compose them to build complex UI

$ Every react app has at least one component, 
  which we refer to as the root component
  -- This This component represents the entire application and contains
    -- other child components. So every React application is essentially
        -- a tree of components
        -- each component is a piece of UI
        We can build these components in isolation 
        and then put them together to build complex UI's

A component is typically
implemented as a JavaScript class that has some state 
and a render method
Ex::
class Tweet{
    state={}
    render(){}
}

The state here is the data that we want to display
when the component is rendered,
and 
the render method responsible 
for describing what the UI should look like.

The output of this render method is a react element, 
which is a
simple plain JavaScript object that reacts to a DOM element.
